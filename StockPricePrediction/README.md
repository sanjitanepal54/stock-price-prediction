## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and RNN
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of five different stocks of Nepal using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN ( Recurrent Neural Networks) models. By comparing the performance of these two popular types of recurrent neural networks, we seek to gain insights into their effectiveness in predicting stock prices.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate LSTM and RNN models for stock price prediction. We focus on the following five stocks:

    1. LBBL
    2. NABIL
    3. NBL
    4. NHPC
    5. SICL

For each stock, historical price data and relevant features are used to train the LSTM and RNN models. The trained models are then utilized to make predictions of future stock prices and the performance is compared between two neural networks.

## Getting Started

To replicate or build upon this project, follow these steps:

1. **Requirements** : Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and relevant libraries for data preprocessing and visualization.

2. **Data Collection** : Collect historical price data for the five stocks and any additional features you wish to incorporate into the models.

3. **Data Preprocessing** : Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing the features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Implementation** : Implement LSTM and RNN models using your chosen deep learning framework.

5. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM and GRU models using the prepared training dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using the testing dataset and calculate relevant performance metrics.

7. **Comparison and Analysis**: Compare the performance of the LSTM and RNN models for each stock, analyze the results, and draw conclusions.

## Results and Discussion

The results of the LSTM and RNN models for each stock are presented and compared. Performance metrics, such as RMSE provide insights into the predictive capabilities of the models.
